## Tres Sismos (Spanish. Three Earthquakes)

There was an earthquake in western Mexico on 19th september 2022. It wasn't very strong. What made it
special is that it was the third one on a 19th september in recent years. Many people asked for
the possibility of that happening.

A solution is offered, both analytical and with code. At the end I added a brief discussion on
why our "natural" intuitions of a probability do not always concide with the actual results.

It's a simple problem with a straightforward solution. A nice twist is that the solution with
code is simpler and more intuitive than the one with binomials. It can be used for a course
along the lines of "how to do probability and statistics with code only".
